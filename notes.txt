React - for single page applications - SPA

before react it was popular to make html document for every page:
index.html
contacts.html ...
React works only with one html file and changes its content
It is convinient, because there is only one downloading of page - user do not need to reload
page in every action.

Actually everything what makes react can be made using only JS - but it is slow approach.
